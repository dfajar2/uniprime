o INSTALLATION

 Universal Primer Design Tools (UniPrime) has been installed
 on many forms of Linux/Unix.


o SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

 - Perl 5.005 or later.

 - Bioperl modules: UniPrime uses functionality provided
  in Bioperl modules. (see http://www.bioperl.org/)
   
 - Primer3 is mandatory since UniPrime is base on Primer3.
   (see http://primer3.sourceforge.net/)
   
 - T-coffee is mandatory if you plan to use multi-alignment option.
   (see http://www.ebi.ac.uk/tcoffeew/)

 - PostgreSQL is mandatory since UniPrime store all the sequences,
   alignments and primers in a database.
   (see http://www.postgresql.org/)

 After installing Primer3 and T-coffee packages on your system,
 you may edit the environmental variable $PRIMER3DIR and $TCOFFEEDIR
 or your $PATH variable to point to the Primer3 and T-coffee
 directories respectively. Ensure that users have execute
 privileges for those programs. 


o INSTALLING UNIPRIME

   Download, then unpack the tar file. For example:

     bunzip2 uniprime-1.18.tar.bz2
     tar xvf uniprime-1.18.tar
     cd uniprime-1.18

   Now issue the make commands to install the Bioperl modules:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make            
     sudo make install    
 
   To 'make install' you need write permission in the perl5/site_perl/ 
   source area.

   Initialising the Database:

     createdb uniprime
     psql uniprime < uniprime.sql

   This process assumes that you are using a functional postgreSQL
   server/client and the current user is registered as an SQL user.
   (see postgreSQL installation manual). 


o INSTALLING THE WEB-COMPANION
 
   Copy the web pages in your web server root (usually /var/www/html)
   and grant the access to the database to the web server user
   (usually www or www-admin):

     cp -r www/uniprime /your_web_server_path
     chown -R web-server-user:web-server-group /your_web_server_path/uniprime
     ./grant.sh web-server-user | psql uniprime
   
   then use your web browser to finalise the installation:

     http://SERVER-ADDRESS/uniprime/install.php
